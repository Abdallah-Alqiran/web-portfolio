## 🔧 Features

-- A fully responsive personal portfolio website built using React and Vite to showcase my skills, projects, and background as a front-end developer.

--The site features a clean, modern UI designed with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI, smooth scroll-based navigation, animated transitions using Framer Motion, and dark/light theme switching.

--Dynamic content such as courses and projects is fetched from Firebase, with data handling powered by TanStack Query. The layout adapts seamlessly to all screen sizes, providing an optimized experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop.

--In collaboration with my teammate Abdalla, a mobile admin version was developed to allow easy editing and management of portfolio data through Firebase.
